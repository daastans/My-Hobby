                  Reading
               </h2>
               <p >
                  Reading is contagious.
                  Seventy-five percent of parents wish their children would read more for fun,
                  and those who want to encourage their children to become bookworms can start by reading out loud at home.
                  While most parents stop reading out loud after their children learn to do it on their own,
                  a new report from Scholastic suggests that reading out loud to kids throughout their elementary school years may inspire them to become 
                  frequent readers—meaning kids who read five to seven days per week for fun.

               <h2>Cooking</h2>
               <p>
                  Cooking is one of the most productive hobbies out there, and something everyone should consider trying their hand at.
                  Cooking forces you to be in the moment, focusing entirely on the product and processes at hand. It also forces you to plan ahead.
                  As a bonus, with practice, you’ll get really good at preparing and making food in advance for the days ahead, meaning you’re being 
                  even more productive than you realized.

               <p>
                  One of the most productive hobbies to have is to write in your spare time. Writing is an incredibly powerful and important
                  form of self-expression and it can help to channel your energies into something which you feel passionate about and in which 
                  you can pour your thoughts, dreams, and desires.Whether it’s writing articles, plays, radio scripts or diary entries, writing 
                  helps unlock your creative side, and helps you be as productive and healthy as possible.
                  To kickstart writing, you don’t need to write a lot of words, try writing journal, or just write 750 words a day:

               </h2>
               <p>Okay, so maybe this last one isn’t what is technically considered to be a ‘hobby’, but it still has benefits when practiced regularly 
                  and will make you more productive if used correctly.Daydreaming awakens your creative side and allows you to explore ideas
                  that you never even considered – even ideas that might just prove to be the solution you’ve been after.If daydreaming leads to napping, 
                  that’s even better – studies have shown that a quick 20 minute nap in the afternoon can help provide clarity, memory retention,
                  and help make you even more focused and productive with your batteries recharged.
