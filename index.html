        Reading

          Reading is contagious.
      
        Seventy-five percent of parents wish their children would read more for fun,
        and those who want to encourage their children to become bookworms can start by reading out loud at home.
        While most parents stop reading out loud after their children learn to do it on their own,
        a new report from Scholastic suggests that reading out loud to kids throughout their elementary school years may inspire them to become 
        frequent readers—meaning kids who read five to seven days per week for fun.
